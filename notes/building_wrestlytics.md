### Product:
**Stage 1:** A web-based tool for coaches to organize and store the training footage of their athletes and to easily track their athletes techniques and reps
+ Prefer to create react-based web app, then use react native for mobile development
+ Give users a pre-defined set of skills but also let them define new skills
    + Pre-defined skills enable better easier training for stage 3
    + Define new skills option improves understanding of what coaches want tracked
+ Create dashboards for analyzing athletes performance over time

**Stage 2:** Add skill trees, i.e. learning pathways to skill mastery
+ Skill trees may or may be visible to users or may only exist on back-end
+ Possible to generate custom trees for users as subset of the master tree
+ “Specify leaf, generate ‘critical path’ custom course”

**Stage 3:** Add computer vision algorithms to largely automate athletes’ rep tracking

**Stage 4:** Expand product offering to other sports
+ Possible route: cash cow pro sports Football, Baseball, Basketball
+ Possible route: niche upper-middle-class to upper-class sports Golf, Tennis, Gymnastics
+ Individual sports & endeavors? e.g. weightlifting, 

**Stage 5:** Expand to learning skills in general (with or without coaches/teachers??)
